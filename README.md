# Practical Task Repository for Test-Driven Development

## Task Description
Implement the [Game of Life](https://playgameoflife.com/) service according to the test-driven development (TDD) approach.

Rules:
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 

## Task-Specific Guidelines 
* Follow the TDD approach to achieve the goal of the task.
* Implement an interface and update only one method in each TDD cycle *(Red-Green-Refactor)*.
* Every step of the TDD cycle should be in a separate commit.

## General Task Guidelines

* Please make corrections per the principles/topics discussed so far in this course.
* It is recommended that you complete the practical tasks for a topic before proceeding to the next topics.
